# LoveLive: School Idol Festival - Database

A card database for the LoveLive: School Idol Festival mobile game.

**Planned features:**
- [x] Database of cards and relevant data (mostly complete)
- [ ] User accounts with opt-in listing in friend finder
- [ ] 'Collection manager' thingy with best-team-for-song-X whatsit
- [ ] Perhaps a random draw emulator?
- [ ] Open to suggestions!

**Current Stack:**
- Python 2.7
	- Flask
	- SQLAlchemy
	- WTForms
	- (various bindings between the above)
- MySQL (I use MariaDB 10, though any MySQL distribution should work)
- No client side framework (though I do like the look of angular, if one is needed)

## Setting up

Setup / distribution / contributing guides to come.

If you feel you could help out on this project, pull requests are absolutely open - I'll review any requests sent in as soon as I can. Frontend is the area with the least coverage currently, I'm no designer.
